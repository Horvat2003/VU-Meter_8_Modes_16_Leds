    Adafruit Electret Microphone Amplifier - MAX4466 with Adjustable Gain connected to Analogo Pin A5.
    Push button conneted  pin 1  to ground with a 10k resistor.
    All leds cathodes to ground and anode connected through a 120 ohms resistor to Arduino pins.
    Resistor values change if different led colors are used.
    Code adapted from Adafruit's amplie tie code and Toni Birka VU-Meter:
